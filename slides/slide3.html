<h1>(Slide 3) The Intellectual and Technological Legacy Microsoft Has on Washington.</h1>
<p>
    Andy Hurst quotes this on her interview with Bill Radke "It kinda puts seatle on the <br>
    map as a test hub and, you know think about, for decades this region was defined by boeing you know this tends to be a<br>
    companey town, a industry town and boeing kinda set the, set the tone and it was, it was a munufacturing company, you <br>
    know there where engineers but there where also machinests on the line, it was a place where you made things. Um a blue<br>
    towler town and, and Microsoft esendants and it was along with other, you know, inportant tech and biotech and telecom <br>
    companys. But realy starts redefining this region as a place that makes ideas, its a knowlege economy hub and thats realy <br>
    different." Another source by Dale A.Lanbert & Dustin W.Clark named "The Beginings of Microsoft" states " The most sighnificant<br>
    product of Microsofts success was the accessability of technology, for a whole generation of people, Microsoft made the <br>
    computer not only practicle, but essential. This evidence Shows that Microsoft changed Washingtons direction in not only <br>
    industies in Washington but also peoples lifestyle.

<p>
    The source "The Beginings of Microsoft" also states "Because Wastington was already home to Microsoft, there was a large <br>
    pool of computer liberate and savvy programers who were willing to attempt new ventures. Suddenly, Washington, especialy <br>
    the puget sound, became the hub of a growing technology economy." This article also states "They desined software that would<br>
    make the computer not just practicle for average individuals, but also eazy to use." This evidence shows that Microsoft <br>
    changed the state by enploying computer savvy people and once again changing the average persons life style by adding <Br>
    computers.
