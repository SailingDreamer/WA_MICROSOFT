    Bill Gates, born in October 28th 1955.<br>
    Had a older sister born in 1953 named Kristianne <br>
    and a younger sister Kibby born in 1664. <br>
    Bill became board with school. One thing to do to <br>
    pass time would be to challenge himself. Like, write 
    with his left hand. once he reached highschool his parents<br>
    where worryed about his hight and feared that people<br>
    would bully him. His parents decited to put him in private <br>
    lakeside university this is where in 1968 bill and others found<br>
    a machine called the telletype. This machine was used to<br>
    send and resieve information using the telephone line.<br>
    Bill and other people at school started learning how <br>
    to code using computer manuels. People learned many <br>
    different programing languages back then like and BASIC<br>
    and FORTRAN. Each language had its own syntax or gramer to <br>
    follow. Bill made his first program when he was 13 years old. <br>
    It was for playing the game tic tac toe. Other students at <br>
    Lakeside started complaning that Bill was using the computer<br>
    to much and hoging it. But coding for Bill was nearing an <br>
    end as General Electric was charging 89$ per month and 8$ <br>
    an hour to use the teletype machine. This was a problem because<br>
    his parents would not pay for the teletyple machine, this was <br>
    how Bill came up with the idea that he could code for <br>
    money.
