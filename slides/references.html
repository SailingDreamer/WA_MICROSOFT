educated forgin people who immigrated to washington to work in Microsoft.

Lambert, Dale A., and Dustin W. Clark. Washington: A State of Contrasts. 2nd ed., East Wenatchee,<br>

Page 397 - this was a secondary source that taught me about the beginnings of Microsoft - not much<br>
 about Bill Gates' early life but lots about what Microsoft intended to do as a small company in <br>
 the beginning. The source gave answers to most of the beginnings of microsoft topic questions.

Lesinski, Jeanne M. Bill Gates. Minneapolis, Lerner Publications, 2006.

page 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. This secondary source told me that Bill found computers really interesting<br>
 and a company called c^3 hired him to test their programs - at this time period there weren't many <br>
 people who knew how to code so people like bill where the only people c^3 could hire - bill would <br>
 come in and test c^3 programs to look for bugs and crashes in the programs. he was able to crash the<br>
  program in 30 minutes. This answered How Bill Gates & Paul Allan became friends.

Excused* for the 4th topic (I had enough info that  didn't need to have another topic)
